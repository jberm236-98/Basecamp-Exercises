## API key
You'll need an Anthropic API key for all build-along sessions — and you don't need a terminal to set it. Run the notebook's setup cell once: it creates a gitignored **`.env`** file. Open it, paste your key after `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=`, save, and re-run — a green **"✓ API key verified"** banner confirms you're connected. The key lives in `.env`, never in a notebook cell (notebooks have a way of ending up in client repos), it survives kernel restarts, and a single `.env` at the repo root serves every exercise.

Prefer to set it once for everything? That works too:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here   # your shell, the VS Code terminal, or a local .env
```

## Where to run
These build-alongs are meant to run in your own tooling, not a browser scratchpad — and never by pasting code out of a chat window:

- **VS Code / Cursor** — open the folder, then the notebook (Jupyter extension) or run the `.py` in the terminal.
- **Claude Code (CLI)** — `claude` inside the repo: run the `.py`, or work the exercise with Claude Code as your pair.
- **Claude Desktop** — keep it open alongside as your AI pair for concepts and debugging.

Each session's README has the exact steps.

## Setup & troubleshooting

The notebooks install what they need on first run and survive locked-down corporate Pythons
(the `externally-managed-environment` / PEP 668 error, no-admin machines, proxies). If you hit
a wall, **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** is the one-page fix — it covers the venv path, the VS Code
"wrong kernel" trap, and corporate-proxy installs. For a pinned environment up front:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
